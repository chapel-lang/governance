Chapel Governance
=================

Chapel is a programming language that productively supports parallel
programming for multi-core CPUs and GPUs from laptops to
supercomputers.

This repository is the authoritative location for Chapel governance.
The formal, legal description our governance model is available in
[TechCharter.pdf](TechCharter.pdf).  The file
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) is a living document that covers many
of the practicalities of governance including roles, who holds them,
and our decision-making process.
