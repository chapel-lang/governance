Governance of the Chapel Project
================================

This file describes the current governance of the Chapel Language
project, covering the language's definition; the code base that
implements its compiler, library modules, and runtime; and the
project's documentation.  It was last updated in February 2025.  This
file goes hand-in-hand with the project's technical charter,
`CHARTER.md`, which defines the project's operations, IP policy, and
serves as the core governance of the project's LLC.

Over time, we anticipate improving the Chapel project's governance.
If you have specific requests with respect to how the project is
governed, please feel encouraged to capture those in an issue on this
repository, or to bring it up [in our community
forums](https://chapel-lang.org/community/).


This document has two main sections, one defining technical roles and
a second outlining the project's decision-making process.


Technical Roles
===============

This section defines the following technical roles for the Chapel
community:

* the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and its Chair or "Tech Lead"
* Subteam Leads, who are tasked with heading up specific efforts
* Committers, who have merge permissions to the repository
* Contributors, who have contributed technical artifacts into the
  Chapel release
* Community Collaborators, who contribute in other ways such as
  feature requests, bug reports, and feedback.

Generally speaking, all committers are contributors, and any
contributor or community collaborator can request to join the TSC.


Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
----------------------------------

Role: The project's overall technical direction is governed by the
Technical Steering Committee, whose members' roles are detailed in
`CHARTER.md`.  Current members of the TSC are:

* TODO...
* 

See `CHARTER.md` for additional information about TSC membership,
roles, and responsibilities.


TSC Chair / Tech Lead
---------------------

Role: The project technical lead's role is to help guide decisions for
the project in ways that are technically sound, responsive to user
needs and concerns, cognizant of the project's history and past
decisions, and compatible with other efforts being undertaken across
the project.  The technical lead serves as the chair of the TSC, and
in that role, presides over meetings of the TSC and serves as the
primary communication contact between the Chapel project and the High
Performance Software Foundation (HPSF).  The TSC Chair will serve
until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.

[Brad Chamberlain](https://github.com/bradcray) currently holds this
role, as a founding member of the Chapel project who has been
continually involved with it since the outset.  Brad has served as the
technical lead of the project since 2006, after inheriting it from
David Callahan.


Subteam Leads
-------------

Role: As the scope of the Chapel project has grown, a number of
subteams have been spun up to focus on specific initiatives at finer
granularities.  Generally speaking, these subteam leads have a great
deal of latitude in making decisions to meet their subteams' goals,
but are expected to keep the TSC, through its chair, aware of major
decisions, particularly for those that are contentious, represent a
significant change in direction, or have the possibility of impacting
other subteams.

At present, the Chapel subteam leads are as follows:

* Community Management: [Brandon Neth](https://github.com/brandon-neth)
* Compiler: [Ben Harshbarger](https://github.com/benharsh)
* DevOps: [Tim Zinsky](https://github.com/tzinsky)
* GPU: [Engin Kayraklioglu](https://github.com/e-kayrakli)
* Performance: [Andy Stone](https://github.com/stonea)
* Runtime, Platform, and Portability: [John Hartman](https://github.com/jhh67)
* User Support: [Lydia Duncan](https://github.com/lydia-duncan)


Committers
----------

Role: Committers are those who have merge-commit privileges to the
[main Chapel repository](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel).
These team members are expected to participate in reviewing PRs for
appropriateness, consistency, and potential security issues.
Committers are also typically expected to help with triaging failures
in the nightly regression tests on a rotating basis, though exceptions
are made for those who are also serving as the team's managers or
spending most of their time on other projects.

All PRs are expected to be reviewed by at least one committer other
than the PR's author; specifically, PRs created by a committer should
typically be reviewed by another committer.  An exception exists for
PRs considered "trivial"â€”so simple or straightforward that asking for
a review would feel like a waste of a colleague's time rather than a
benefit to the project.  When in doubt, a review should be requested,
and when a non-trivial PR has been merged, this should be pointed out
to the Committer, optionally through the TSC Chair.  Committers who
don't feel confident reviewing a PR will typically call in additional
committers to help with the review or provide additional thoughts.  A
committer who authors or merges a PR is typically responsible for any
testing fallout caused by that PR, typically by involving the author
when the PR was not theirs.  In some cases, the reviewing committer or
another volunteer may step up to help out.

At present, the list of committers includes all of the
technical leaders listed previously, as well as:

* [Jade Abraham](https://github.com/jabraham17)
* [Soohoon Choi](https://github.com/soohoonchoi)
* [Matt Drozt](https://github.com/MattToast)
* [Daniel Fedorin](https://github.com/DanilaFe)
* [Michael Ferguson](https://github.com/mppf)
* [Abhishek Girish](https://github.com/agirish)
* [Shreyas Khandekar](https://github.com/ShreyasKhandekar)
* [Vass Litvinov](https://github.com/vasslitvinov)
* [David Longnecker](https://github.com/dlongnecke-cray)
* [Ben McDonald](https://github.com/bmcdonald3)
* [Ahmad Rezaii](https://github.com/arezaii)
* [Anna Rift](https://github.com/riftEmber)
* [Elliot Ronaghan](https://github.com/ronawho)
* [Michelle Strout](https://github.com/mstrout)
* [Karlon West](https://github.com/karlonw)


Community Contributors
----------------------

Role: This role describes those who have contributed code or
documentation changes that are part of the project's release
artifacts.  Such contributions are typically made by directly opening
a [pull request (PR) against the main project
repository](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/pulls) containing
and explaining the proposed changes.  The commits within such PRs must
be signed to certify conformance with the [Developer Certificate of
Origin
(DCO)](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

As noted above, such PRs must be reviewed and merged by a core
contributor as a means of maintaining and improving the quality of the
code base, and to help manage any fallout that may show up afterwards,
such as failures or performance regressions in the nightly testing.

Our project tracks the list of core and community contributors in the
main repository's
[CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md)
file, separately identifying those who have contributed to the most
recent release as a means of giving distinction to those who have been
active most recently.


Community Collaborators
-----------------------

Role: This role describes those who are active in the community and
aid us in making the Chapel language and implementation better through
suggestions, questions, feature requests, bug reports, and the like
(as opposed to through direct contributions of code or documentation).
Such contributions are invaluable to the project's effort, and Chapel
has improved immensely over time as a result of them.  We do not
currently track a list of people in this role due to the challenges in
doing so accurately and completely, but it is possible to identify
many such individuals through their interactions on GitHub and in our
[community forums](https://chapel-lang.org/community/).


Decision-Making
===============

Generally speaking, decision-making on the Chapel project is done by
the technical leadership and committers on a consensus basis, taking
the opinions of end-users into account when the decision is likely to
affect them.  Project-wide decisions tend to involve all TSC members
and committers, while those that are specific to a given effort can be
made by a subteam lead and its members, keeping the TSC apprised of
key decisions.

Two flavors of votes are used by the project.  The first type is the
most common and is used to gauge the level of support for an idea or
direction, rather than being strictly binding.  In such votes, those
in the minority are typically given the opportunity to continue to
push for alternative approaches, or to concede to the majority, having
registered their opinion.  Essentially, this type of vote can be
considered a straw poll mechanism to gauge how close or far the
community is from consensus on a given topic.

The second type of vote is a vote of the TSC, which is formal,
binding, and documented in `CHARTER.md`.  In practice, these votes are
taken sparingly for matters that involve the project governance or in
cases where consensus cannot be reached through other means.

For non-trivial decisions in language design, library APIs, or code
architecture, the project or subteam often forms an ad hoc subteam
including at least three committers to explore the topic and propose a
solution, where anyone in the broader community is encouraged to
participate if they feel interested or invested.  Once the ad hoc
subteam has reached a conclusion, it is summarized back to the full
community, typically in a GitHub issue or similarly public setting.
Generally speaking, those who did not volunteer to join the ad hoc
subteam are requested to go along with its decision, unless they have
an insight or strong reason that the proposal is
untenableâ€”particularly if it involves factors the subteam was not, or
could not have been, aware of.  In practice, this has happened only
very rarely.

Decisions that relate to the design of the language or libraries are
captured and discussed on public [GitHub issues labeled with `type:
Design`](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22type%3A%20Design%22)
as a means of soliciting input from the community. Many of these
issues are opened or requested by users directly. Decisions that are
particularly impactful to user codes are advertised directly to users
to get their feedback, by pointing them to the GitHub issues or
contacting them directly.  For some of the most impactful changes, we
run polls and work hard to involve as many users as possible in order
to avoid surprises and attempt to develop a consensus community view.
The TSC chair may serve as a final decision-maker or bring the matter
to the TSC in the event that the community can't come to a decision.
In extreme cases, the TSC Chair may veto a decision, though it is
expected that this would be used only very rarely.
